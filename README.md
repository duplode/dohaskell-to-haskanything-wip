Auxiliary WIP repository for
[HaskAnything issue #33](https://github.com/beerendlauwers/HaskAnything/issues/33).
dhTags and dhTypes are lists of tags and content types originally
found in resources-dump-wip.yaml.

A few things to decide about the conversion:

* Are functional pearls best filled under "articles" or "papers"?

* How many new content types are necessary to cover the still
  unprocessed DoHaskell content types?

* Do we need separate tags for reflection (the concept) and reflection
  (the Edward Kmett library)? What about "lenses" vesus "lens"?

* How to handle capitalisation, specially relative to the existing 
  HaskAnything content?
